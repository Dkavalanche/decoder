# decoder
Another Grandoreiro malware decoder but in assembler 

Inspired by the Python code of SpiderLabs  
https://github.com/SpiderLabs/Grandoreiro-decryptor/blob/main/grandoreiro_string_decryptor.py

And the Delphi routine, posted at PlanetaDelphi.com.br

Made in assembler as a challenge of my own.
